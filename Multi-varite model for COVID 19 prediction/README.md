# Muti-varite model for COVID 19 Prediction

This is the a data science project mainly focus on the prediction for the development of COVID in Virginia State. The folder contians 4 parts: 1 written report, 1 presentation slide, 2 model folder.

The research is devoted to predicting the volume of existing COVID-19 cases in the future to illustrate the situation of the pandemic to facilitate policymaking. In this research, my team member and I proposed multi-variate method takes those factors into consideration based on an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model with K-fold training. Unlike traditional compartmental models in epidemiology, the sequence of time is ignored during training with shattered data. The proposed model is tested on a Virginia state dataset with a comparison of SIR model. It turns out that the XGBoost model has an outstanding performance in prediction accuracy and much better generalization than the SIR, especially for a long-term prediction.
