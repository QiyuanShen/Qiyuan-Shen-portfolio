VA has been lauded time and time again as one of the States with the most effective COVID contact tracing mechanisms.)     On Wednesday, August 5, 2020, Virginia鈥檚 coronavirus notification app, called Covidwise, was launched, just under four months after the Apple-Google partnership was first announced.    Rather than tracking users' identity and location, Virginia officials say, the Bluetooth technology creates anonymous ""tokens,"" or random sequences of numbers, and exchanges them with other nearby users. The app uses that information to inform users if they've been near someone who has reported a positive test.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201213022348/https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/08/05/899414953/virginia-unveils-app-to-aid-contact-tracing",0,,0,,2,1,,,,,1,1,,,,95049,2274,61.57,61.57,70.24,70.24,57.03,57.03,59.82,59.82,37.5,37.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Commonwealth will work in partnership with the Virginia Community College System to scale up the Network2Work model in the Shenandoah Valley, Hampton Roads, and Greater Richmond regions.    鈥淧eople across our Commonwealth are facing unprecedented and far-reaching impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and challenging times like these call for innovative solutions,鈥?said Governor Northam. 鈥淣etwork2Work uses a proactive approach to workforce development, leveraging community-based networks to connect job seekers with the skills and resources they need to find employment despite barriers that might include lack of childcare, transportation, or other necessities. With the expansion of this program, we will get more Virginians back to work, help employers secure the talent they need to thrive, and put our economy in a strong position to rebound from this crisis.鈥?   https://web.archive.org/web/20201022211014/https://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/12330",1,,0,,,,2,1,,3,,2,,0,,0,,2,1,,,,,1,1,,,,153182,3291,50.46,50.46,58.33,58.33,50.78,50.78,52.68,52.68,37.5,37.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, the Virginia Department of Health does not seem to have a policy on using LFT followed by PCR as they group them together into viral tests and therefore no need to re-code data. According to their website,  鈥淭here are two main types of tests for COVID-19: viral tests (PCR or antigen) and antibody tests.  A viral test tells you if you have a current infection by looking for parts of the virus. Swabs that take samples from the nose or throat, or saliva, are used for these tests. Currently, there are two main viral tests used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19):   Molecular tests (also called PCR tests) that look for the virus鈥檚 genetic material, and  Antigen tests that look for a specific protein that is part of the virus.   Antigen tests can be easy to run and may cost less than molecular tests, but are not always as accurate as molecular tests.   At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen or sample at home and either send it to a laboratory for testing, or perform the testing at home. Contact your healthcare provider to see if an at-home specimen collection kit or an at-home test is right for you and available in your area. For more information on at-home testing, visit VDH鈥檚 table on COVID-19 at-home tests here.  An antibody test tells you if you had a past infection by looking for antibodies in the blood鈥? Antibody tests have limited ability to diagnose COVID-19, and should not be used alone for this purpose. Antibody tests should also not be used to evaluate a person鈥檚 level of immunity or protection from COVID-19 at any time, and especially after the person received a COVID-19 vaccination.鈥?   https://web.archive.org/web/20210613035531/https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/",1,no change in policy as of 12 June 2021 so continue to code as 1.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210609222428/https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/prevention-tips/contact-tracing/,0,,0,,2,1,no change in policy as of 12 June 2021 so continue to code as 2G.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210529225226/https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/cloth-face-covers/,5,1,no change in policy as of 12 June 2021 so continue to code as 5G.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210609222104/https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/covid-19-vaccine/,1,1,no change in policy as of 12 June 2021 so continue to code as 1G.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210609222843/https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/health-professionals/virginia-long-term-care-task-force/,,,675597,11194,39.81,39.81,51.19,51.19,51.04,51.04,49.4,49.4,62.5,62.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
