# Heart Disease Prediction model

Heart diseases pre-detection, a medical problem, has confused both scientist and doctors for decades. Numerous data scientist once tried to figure out perfect model for this prediction problem. Here, we want to figure out the relations between the human body indexes and the heart diseases detection results. We select both traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes classifiers and newborn popular method called Catboost as well as widely used comprehensive learning algorithm ensembles including Ada boost, Gradient boost, Random Forest and Extra Tree. By comparing all these six algorithms, we could get a relatively best model for heart diseases pre-detection.
